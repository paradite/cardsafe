HOW TO:<br>
1. Enable NFC on your phone.<br>
2. Tap a card.<br>
3. Save a password (this is associated with the card).<br>
4. Tap your card again to retrieve the password(s).

Why this app is safe:

1. Everything is stored LOCALLY inside the app(not on the cards), nothing can get out of the app. (No permission to use Internet/External storage is required)

2. Both the card and the phone are needed to access the password. (If you lose either one of them, the passwords still remain inaccessible to others)

3. We are planning to add an additional layer of security measure in order to access the passwords, you can email us your suggestions.
